I'm
Front End Developer

The crossover between design and programming has always been of interest to me, I've been lucky enough to work alongside some talented teams on a number of high profile websites. I have a wide range of skills that include design (working closely with designers), front-end development (Angular, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Responsive, UX).
